# Lost-NDS-TV

## Introduction

On December 2020, we discovered that the Nintendo DS Lite's SoC (System on Chip) had a hidden feature: a leftover TV(Television) composite video output signal. This project contains our hardware designs and software code to restore this hidden feature and make it usable again. More details [here](https://lostnintendohistory.github.io/DS-TV-OUT)
